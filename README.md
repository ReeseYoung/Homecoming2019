The project took around a week. We manily struggled with the set up and wire frame. We had different ideas and didn't reallu know how we wanted it to look when we started to code. We figured a few things along the way but we were pretty happy with the way it ended since if one of us had a problem we spoke up about it which resulted in a lot of changes.
